### PaintingCanvas

#### The project enables the user to specify drawing characteristics such as which shape to draw, the stroke color, the fill color and whether the shape should be hollow or filled. It also provides mouse event handling to enable the user to position and size each shape by dragging the mouse. The user can undo the last shape drawn and to clear the entire drawing as well.
